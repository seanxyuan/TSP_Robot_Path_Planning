**Travelling Salesman Problem**

This module is concerned with the finding the optimal route using the TSP solution.

First, get the graph from the 'artificial node' module.

Then, we transform the graph object to a matrix form to be utilized by the TSP algorithm.

Finally, we compute the optimal route, along with the route's cost.
