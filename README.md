**Contour Crafting**

Using the IFC files generated by Autodesk Revit, we are creating a raw graph level representation of the structure. We would then generate a cost matrix for the structure, which would be feed to the TSP problem. The TSP would then give the most feasible route to generate the model. The model then would be GCode, which would be eventually fed to the 3D printer/robot to construct the model.
